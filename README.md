# clsim

An OpenCL-based photon-tracking simulation using a (source-based) ray tracing algorithm
modeling scattering and absorption of light in the deep glacial ice at the South Pole
or Mediterranean sea water.

## Hole-Ice Support

This is a fork of clsim that is used to integrate hole ice into the clsim photon propagation.
